# w20WerewolfSheet
A W20 (World of Darkness) Werewolf Character Sheet (local-storage html page)

This project is intended to be a self-contained, local-storage HTML file, capable of editing and storing a w20 Werewolf: The Apocalypse character sheet. 

Developer Goals

Local-Saving
- I intend to have this generate a file to store the Character Sheet contents, and to have the capability of loading this back to the page. 

CSV or XML Character Stat Libraries
- I intend to eventually populate most of the drop-box inputs from externally-saved CSV or XML sources. This allows for a user to add/remove custom items for their chronicle, simply by editing the CSV or XML file. (If I succeed, I may also develop a Javascript page to edit this csv/xml sheet, as time and experience allow.)

Stretch Goal: XP Tracking
- An added function that would be nice is to add a toggle for "base creation" and "xp spending", and add a tracker for Creation Points and Experience Points spent when generating a character.
